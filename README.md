## ðŸ“Š Mood vs. Evening Social Media Usage â€“ Statistical Analysis Project

This research project analyzed the potential effects of prolonged social media usage on evening mood using survey data from 90 participants (aged 13â€“65+). Participants reported mood scores for morning and evening, and usage patterns were categorized into four levels (low to very high). Through data preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualization (boxplots, histograms, countplots, correlation matrices), we explored potential correlations.

Using the **Chi-Square Test of Independence**, we tested the null hypothesis that social media usage does not affect evening mood. The resulting **p-value (> 0.1)** indicated no statistically significant relationship, leading us to accept the null hypothesis. Contrary to common assumptions, the data showed **no clear evidence that evening social media use causes mood declines**, highlighting the complex nature of digital engagement and emotional well-being.

### ðŸ”§ Tools & Techniques
